# Colormaster Quiz #

<p>This quiz will test, and help you better understand, the flow of control in bash and git. It's designed to 
cover all of the commands we learned in class. If you find yourself getting stuck on a certain step, let 
an instructor know! </p>

## Some Background ##

<p>You are the Colormaster. You know your colors better than anybody else in the world... which is how you came
to be the Colormaster to begin with... which has only improved your mastery of colors. 
You're basically the Gandalf of colors is what we're saying. Anyway, as the Colormaster
it's your job to keep the colors straight! You've been camping in Alaska for the past nine months, 
far, far away from your directories, and while you were been gone, someone has wreaked havoc on your filesystem.
Colors have been de-sorted, mis-sorted, and entire directories are missing! It's a massacre! Luckily,
you can fix this. </p>

### Here's some help: ###
<ol>
<li>Fork this repo.</li>
<li><p>Clone your newly forked repo to your local machine (from whatever folder you store your code in).</p>
	You should get a filesystem that looks something like:

</li>
    color-master-quiz
    >     |
    >     |
    >   --------------------------
    >   |       |        |       |
    > green   purple    red    unsorted

</li>
<li>Change into this newly cloned directory. You will be prompted if you want to continue. Type 'y' and hit enter.</li>
<li>Start from the color-master-quiz directory (you should be dropped into it automatically). Now to repair the damage:</li>
<li> <strong> Challange 1: Modifying Files </strong>
	  <p>In each of the folders named after a color (ex. purple) there are some files. Somebody
		has mischeviously erased the descriptions of each object! Change into each color directory and
		open each file to fill in the names of each object and complete this challenge (all lower case).</p>
		<ul>
			<li>[ ] Fill in the blank in plum.txt in the purple directory</li>
			<li>[ ] Fill in the blank tree.txt in green directory</li>
			<li>[ ] Fill in the blanks in apple.txt and firetruck.txt in the red directory</li>
		</ul>
</li>

<li> <strong> Challenge 2: Creating Files </strong>
	<p> Follow the directions for each of the tasks below </p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>[ ] In your purple directory, create a file called </p>

				<p>grape.txt</p>

				<p>In this new file, paste the following: </p>

				<p>I'm a grape!</p>

			</li>
		</ul>

</li>
</ol>
