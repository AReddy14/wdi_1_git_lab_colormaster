This quiz will test, and help you better understand, the flow of control in bash and git. It's designed to 
cover all of the commands we learned in class. If you find yourself getting stuck on a certain step, let 
an instructor know! 

# Colormaster Quiz #

You are the colormaster. You know your colors better than anybody else in the world, which is really how you came
to be the colormaster in the first place. You're basically the Gandalf of colors is what we're saying. As the colormaster
it's your job to keep the colors straight! You've been camping in Alaska for the past nine months, far, far away from your directories, and while you were been gone, someone has wreaked havoc on your filesystem. Colors are unsorted, mis-sorted, and entire directories are missing! It's a massacre! Luckily,
you can fix this. 

Here's some help:

1. start from the color-master-quiz directory (you should be dropped into it automatically)
2. Challange 1: Modifying Files
	- In each of the folders named after a color (ex. purple) there are some files. Somebody
		has mischeviously erased the descriptions of each object! Fill in the names to complete this
		challenge (all lower case).
	[ ] Fix files in purple directory
	[ ] Fix files in green directory
	[ ] Fix files in the red folder
